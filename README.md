## About this application

(Note: This application requires a Spotify account.) 

Jammming allows the user to search Spotify, add and remove tracks from the returned search results to a playlist, edit the name of the playlist, and finally to save the playlist -- which will then appear in the user's Spotify account.

It was built as the capstone project for Codecademy.com's "Build Front-End Web Applications from Scratch" intensive. As a starting point, all CSS was provided, as was a flat HTML file for each Component. Students were tasked with writing all JavaScript and converting HTML to JSX. A certain level of step-by-step hand-holding was involved, but students had to create functioning JavaScript from plain English intructions. (Example: "32. Pass the state of the App component's searchResults to the SearchResults component. 33. Pass the search results from the SearchResults component to the TrackList component. 34. In the TrackList component, use the .map() method to render each track in the tracks property. Set the key attribute to track.id. 35. Render the track name, artist, and album.")

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
